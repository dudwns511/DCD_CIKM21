## Dual Correction Strategy for Ranking Distillation in Top-N Recommender System

- This is the code of ["Dual Correction Strategy for Ranking Distillation in Top-N Recommender System (CIKM 21)"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03459)

- This code is implemented based on the author code of ["DE-RRD: A Knowledge Distillation Framework for Recommender System (CIKM 20)"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04357) and we modified data preprocessing and run.py code at [DR-RRD](https://github.com/SeongKu-Kang/DE-RRD_CIKM20) and [IR-RRD](https://github.com/SeongKu-Kang/IR-RRD_INS21)
